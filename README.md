# Bayesian Classification
Final project for EAS-595 course (Probability Theory), Fall 2018.

This project makes use of the famous Bayesâ€™ theorem for the purpose of predicting classes of the input data points. The project also experiments with transformation of data in order to improve the accuracy of the classifier. The improvement in the accuracy is observed and visualized to understand that collected data often need to be preprocessed in order to make it more meaningful. Finally, a multivariate classifier is also constructed and compared with its univariate counterpart for various cases.
